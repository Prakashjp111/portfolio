                Last semester, I worked on a team project that involved developing a mobile app for tracking fitness goals. I learned a lot about software development processes and project management during that experience.
            </p>

                After graduation, I hope to work as a software engineer at a tech company, where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. In my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and learning about new technologies in the field.
